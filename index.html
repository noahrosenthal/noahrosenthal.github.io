    <h1>Noah Rosenthal's favorite team Boston Celtics</h1>
    <p> I grew up a Boston Celtics fan after watching my older brother of 2 years like them. I did not know at the time that basketball would essentially become my life or the Celtics would become my favorite team. Growing up I akways used to dress up as either Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce or Rajon Rondo. It didnt matter wether it was Halloween or just a normal school day, I wanted to represent my team and my favorite players. This genuine passion I had for the Celtics only grew as I grew. I was an athlete my whole life playing every sport whenever I had any free time. Towards the end of my short career, I decided to go all-in on basketball. This meant dedicating more time to practice and play but also letting go of some other sports such as baseball, football and tennis. No, at the time this was not the easiest decision but I am grateful for it looking back. After that, I carried my basketball with me wherever i went. It became my safe haven, if anything or anyone in life tried to bring me down, I always knew one place nobody could affect me... the basketball court. After my time on the court was done, I needed a way to fulfill that gap that had been left behind. Through this I found that watching the Celtics on a night-to-night basis gave me the emotions I had been missing since leaving the court.</p>
<h2>History of The Celtics</h2>
<p> The Celtics are in my opinion the most storied franchise in NBA history. They and the Los Angeles Lakers hold the lead for the  most NBA Chamoionships, 17. It has been a race to #18. The Celtics are one of the oldest and most successful franchises. Founded in 1946, the team had particular success in the 1950s and 60s. At the time they were led by the legend Red Auerbach and Hall of Fame players, Bill Russell, Bob Cousy, and John Havlicek. These players made Boston a powerhouse for many hears to come. They continued their competitiveness and success throughout the 70s and 80s and most recently a championship in 2008. The Celtics have produced a number of Hall of Fame players and many legends of the sport.</p>

<h2>The 2022-23 Boston Celtics</h2>
<p> The 22-23 Boston Celtics are a talented and deep team that is expected to contend for the NBA championship. Led by All-Stars Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, the Celtics have a strong starting lineup that can score and defend at a high level. Tatum, in particular, has emerged as one of the best players in the league, averaging over 30 points per game and earning a spot on the All-Star Team. The Celtics also have a talented supporting cast, including Marcus Smart, who provides tough defense and playmaking.
 In addition to their star power, the Celtics have one of the deepest rosters in the league, with several players capable of contributing off the bench. This depth has allowed the team to stay fresh throughout the season and maintain their high level of play even when key players are out due to injury. With a strong coaching staff led by Joe Mazzulla, the Celtics have also shown an ability to make adjustments on the fly and find ways to win games. Overall, the 22-23 Boston Celtics are a well-rounded and dangerous team that should be feared by their opponents in the upcoming playoffs.</p>
