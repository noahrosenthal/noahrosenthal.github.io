    <p> I grew up a Boston Celtics fan ater watching my older brother of 2 years like them. I did not know at the time that basketball would essentially become my life or the Celtics would become my favorite team. Growing up I akways used to dress up as either Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce or Rajon Rondo. It didnt matter wether it was Halloween or just a normal school day, I wanted to represent my team and my favorite players. This genuine passion I had for the Celtics only grew as I grew. I was an athlete my whole life playing every sport whenever I had any free time. Towards the end of my short career, I decided to go all-in on basketball. This meant dedicating more time to practice and play but also letting go of some other sports such as baseball, football and tennis. No, at the time this was not the easiest decision but I am grateful for it looking back. After that, I carried my basketball with me wherever i went. It became my safe haven, if anything or anyonne in life tried to bring me down, I always knew one place nobody could affect me, the basketball court.
