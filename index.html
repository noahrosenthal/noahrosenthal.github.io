    <p> I grew up a Boston Celtics fan ater watching my older brother of 2 years like them. I did not know at the time that basketball would essentially become my life or the Celtics would become my favorite team. Growing up I akways used to dress up as either Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce or Rajon Rondo. It didnt matter wether it was Halloween or just a normal school day, I wanted to represent my team and my favorite players.
